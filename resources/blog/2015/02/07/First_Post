What is dougpuett.com? For me, it is or should be a home. My wife talks constantly about nesting, about how she needs to create her space, her life-place. And I feel that same way, now, having this sense of freedom that technology can bring. If I had my own house, what would I do with it? I'd maybe like an office, or a library, or a media room, but that's not where I live. I live here, in this mind and in a creative space. And I can create that here and now. I had the pleasure of reading over the last few days a work called *[Patterns in Software](http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf)*, by Richard Gabriel which is largely about the philosophy of an architect named Christopher Alexander. I would encourage anyone to read it, even if they aren't in software, because he spends a lot of time talk about design, and moreover, *habituality*, especially of dwellings and software. I am in no way prepared for the question: "How then should I live?" at least let me answer: "Where then should I live?"
